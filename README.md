# üì∞ Classification of Urdu News Articles

This project is focused on classifying Urdu news articles into predefined categories using custom machine learning models. It addresses the lack of language-specific tools for Urdu and aims to support personalized content delivery by transforming unstructured news data into organized, labeled information.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The core objective of this project is to:

- Scrape Urdu-language news articles from popular local news websites.
- Preprocess and clean the text data.
- Classify each article into one of the following five categories:
  1. Entertainment
  2. Business
  3. Sports
  4. Science-Technology
  5. International
- Implement at least three machine learning models **from scratch** (no `sklearn` usage allowed for grading).
- Evaluate and compare model performance to select the best classifier.

## üîç Data Collection

Articles are scraped from the following Urdu news sources:

- [Geo News Urdu](https://urdu.geo.tv)
- [Jang News](https://jang.com.pk)
- [ARY Urdu](https://urdu.arynews.tv)
- [Dunya News Urdu](https://dunya.com.pk)
- [Express News Urdu](https://express.pk)

Each article is saved with the following fields:
- `Article ID`
- `URL`
- `Title`
- `Content`
- `Gold Label` (true category)

---

## üîß Preprocessing & EDA

Preprocessing steps include:

- Removing HTML tags and non-Urdu characters
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal (Urdu-specific)
- Handling missing values
- Balancing classes (if necessary)

EDA includes:
- Category distribution
- Word frequency analysis
- Article length statistics

---

## üß† Model Implementation

The following models have been implemented **from scratch**:
1. **Naive Bayes Classifier**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network)**

Each model was trained and tested on the dataset, and evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

(Sklearn models may be used **for comparison only**, not for grading.)

---

## üèÅ Final Report

A detailed report written in **ACM format** is included in the `/report` folder. It contains:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Data Collection & Cleaning
- Model Descriptions
- Evaluation Results
- Conclusion & Future Work
